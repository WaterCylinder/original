     * @class syncPoint
     * @brief Synchronization point for multiple threads
     * @details
     * A synchronization primitive that allows multiple threads to wait for each other
     * at a specific point in execution. Threads call arrive() to indicate they have
     * reached the synchronization point, and the last arriving thread triggers the
     * completion function and releases all waiting threads.
     *
     * Features:
     * - Reusable barrier that can be used for multiple synchronization rounds
     * - Optional completion function executed by the last arriving thread
     * - Exception safety - exceptions in completion function are propagated to all threads
     * - Thread-safe arrival counting and notification
     *
